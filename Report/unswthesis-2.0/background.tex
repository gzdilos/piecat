\chapter{Background}\label{ch:background}

Every semester, students ask their supervisor how to write their thesis,
what the requirements are, and what to write in it.  
This document tries to answer all such questions.

This is a sample!!

Previously, Nooshabadi~\cite{Noo05} has descried style-related thesis
requirements, Shepherd~\cite{She05} has provided \LaTeX\ templates while
other academics have discussed contents with their students.  This work
draws all the relevant information regarding thesis writing into one
document.  The present template/document is heavily influenced by
Nooshabadi and Shepherd, incorporating requirements from The Graduate
Research School~\cite{GRS14} for Higher Degree Research theses.
